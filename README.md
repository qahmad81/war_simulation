## War Simulation 
This code for make test simulation of war, this will help how ever who make a game and need to make war simulation in hes game, so this include
- create soldiers data with all status from random
- make attack as tern base
- sure death soldiers not attack or attaked
- on each attack 2 army will be shuffle so each soldier will face another enemy soldier each time
- soldiers have energy stat that decrease whin attak or taking damage
- energy will lower attack as formula = attack * (energy/100), so if soldier have 20 energy attack will lower to 20%
- soldiers have poor energy or poor health will not attack and rest to recover they energy and health by random
- soldiers that not attacked will take rest and rise energy and health by random
- if size of attacker and defencer are differents it will take off the excess amount from larger army to take rest so more army take advantage


and more

## in future
- add lucky, so in defencer more lucky add more miss chance, on attaker give more double damage chance.

and more

## Test
- in 10K of soldier on each army its take only 50 milliseconds from my laptop
- in 100K of soldier on each army its take 500 milliseconds from my laptop
- in 1M of soldier on each army its take 5 second from my laptop, this is amazing!!!

## Sing of this project
this project give as hope to make more simulations, like city economy or animal life or bots life or match more.
