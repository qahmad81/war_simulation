## War Simulation 
This code for make test simulation of war, this will help how ever who make a game and need to make war simulation in hes game, so this include
- create soldiers data with all status from random
- make attack as tern
- sure death soldiers not attack or attaked

and more

## Test
- in 10K of soldier on each army its take 1.2 second from my laptop
- in 50K of soldier on each army its take 25 second from my laptop, this is realy bad :( so we need work in performance

## enhance on performance
to make petter performace we need a method in numby to store update from array on source array as detail in link below

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64513436/in-python-with-numpy-how-can-i-update-array-from-another-array-depend-on-column
or we need take mask of source array as pointer so no need to store data

so if you have the selution please contact me her
